# Iced Workshop

Welcome to the Iced GUI workshop!

Over the course of the hour we will be building a lightweight chat client (a trollbox) in Rust.

Before getting started, here are a few steps to complete on your own:

- Install rustup: https://rustup.rs/
- Clone this repository, navigate to it, and run `cargo check`. This will retrieve the dependencies and ensure that your Rust installation is good to go.
